# 🚨 Emergency & Women Safety Tracker

A real-time emergency response mobile application designed to help users — especially women — trigger **silent SOS alerts**, share **live location**, and automatically collect **audio evidence** during emergencies.

This project focuses on **panic situations**, **low-connectivity scenarios**, and **privacy-first evidence handling**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In emergency situations:
- Unlocking a phone may not be possible
- Internet connectivity may be unstable
- Victims may not be able to speak or call for help
- Evidence is often missing after the incident

Most existing safety apps fail under these real-world constraints.

---

## 🎯 Solution

This system allows users to trigger an SOS using **secret gestures** (button presses, silent triggers) and automatically:
- Alert trusted contacts
- Share live location
- Record audio evidence
- Escalate alerts if no response is received

All while remaining **silent and discreet**.
